## Sample react + mobx data grid.

To run the project use default commands `npm install` and `npm start` after.

I didn't used deleting and updating by keys because the keys are autogenerated and it would be hemorrhoid to pass this key everytime. The method of deleting row by key is implemented, though.

So, in example you can see updating and deleting by indexes.
Also, use __mobx dev tools__ to check partial redrawing of cells after updating.
